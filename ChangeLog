2002-08-24  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * removed rest of the savage.lib dependencies from the
      whole AmIDE source tree. Now AmIDE should be fully C
      without the requirement of the obsolete savage.lib

2002-08-23  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * removed savage.lib dependencies from sasc.module to
      make it easier to understand/useable.
    * reorganized source-code for open-source (GPL) release
      that includes a new smakefile along with a better
      directory structure.

-- old changelog follows ----------------------------------------------------

0.3ß (March 04, 2001)

    March 04, 2001
      - added sasc.module developer stuff to the release-archive.
      - removed bug that messed up the first line of the MsgBrowser
      - now that NListtree seems to be stable I ported AmIDE to use NListtree.mcc instead of Listtree.mcc
      - modified sources to be more CVS friendly
      - splitted sources into more separated modules

    August 2000 - January 2001
      - did some work abroad in india (New Delhi)

    June 28, 2000
      - fixed some nasty null-pointer enforcer-hits in the compiler section.
      - today was my sourcecode-reorder-day. I changed some styles and gained some kB of code :)
    June 27, 2000
      - the descriped changes also removed the enforcer-hit mentioned in the "known Bugs" section.
      - rewritten the compiler-related routines. AmIDE starts a subtask if the compiler gets started
        This makes AmIDE more asynchron in handling output/inputs from/to the compiler.
    June 07, 2000
      - all compiler-related stuff has been moved into seperated shared libraries.
        I also defined a API for people who want to write their own compiler-modules.
        Now it should be easily possible to include other compilers into AmIDE. I will start
        writing new modules for STORM/C, gcc asap.
    June 06, 2000
      - fixed a bug in the checking routine if a file doesn`t exists anymore
    May 27, 2000
      - the modules will be loaded correctly now.
      - finished the API definition for external compiler-modules.
        This will allow programmers to write their own module for their used compiler.

    April 12, 2000
      - now the edittool/viewtool will be started by SystemTags and asynchron
      - the "Run" button in the MessageBrowser works now.
      - if a file is getting compiled and a object-file is be created it will be automatically
        added to the projecttree now.
    April 10, 2000
      - all entries in a project will be checked if a project is loaded and an error-requester
        will be displayed if a file doesn`t exists anymore.
    April 09, 2000
      - the listtree topology will be saved correctly now.
      - activating the contextmenu also sets the Listtree_Activ to the entry under the mouse-pos.
      - added all needed stuff to the new context-menu
    April 04, 2000

    March 13, 2000
      - all depencies will be scanned depending on the depcheck flag of each file
        so all depencies will be loaded correctly of each project-file.

      - compiling is now done by the project class and not by the msgbrowser class
      - now the D&D in the ProjectTree also take care of the binding flag of each file

      - ... puh was on holiday in Australia ... back in cold Germany :((
    August 1999
      - started to rewrite the whole source in BOOPSI language
    July 1999
      - the project was nearly dead because the sourcecode was getting to complicated,
        also I wanted to add multiple project windows what is nearly impossible within an
        non-object oriented environment. -> BOOPSI is the solution :)

0.1ß (January-July 1999)
    - drag&drop in listtree works now and also with respect to filetypes.
    - modified the construction hook for better string allocation

      a different color.

      Errors.

      Chereshnev)

    - started to think about the layout of the GUI and the PIPE mechanism to
      get the output of SAS/C
